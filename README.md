### Hi there 

I am a Data Scientist (in training forever :P) with a background in Regenerative Medicine. 

The last decade belongs to those generating data that will continue to grow in the future. But this decade belongs to the people who can make sense of the data :)

I am gearing up to be part of this revolution, focusing on data-driven precision medicine using meaningful ML and deep learning algorithms.
